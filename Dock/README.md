# macOsFeel Dock
There are many applications that mimic the macOS dock in Windows, but most of them ignore its functionalities. The functionalities that I intent to implement are:
- Three groups in the Dock: Finder+apps, recent apps and folders+bin
- macOS right-click options for apps and folders (Open/Close, Options, ...)
- The ability to navigate throught the folders using the Dock in Fan, Grid or List style.
- An Applications folder in the Dock, allowing the user to launch an app on click, or launch its unninstaller in silent mode by dragging it to the bin (this is not the same thing as the Launchpad).
- Showing minimized windows in the corner, if it's configured to do so.
- Showing a small white dot below the opened applications.
- The capability to add new apps/folders with drag-and-drop.
- The capability to move apps/folders in the Dock with drag-and-drop.
- In the recent apps area, show a minimum of three apps.

It should be based in [CleverDock](https://github.com/ldom66/clever-dock).
